# VASH 3.0 — Objectives and Success Metrics

## Objective 1: Fully Automated SDLC Pipeline

**Statement:** VASH must execute a complete software development lifecycle — from requirements to deployment blueprint — without any human involvement except brief submission and milestone approval.

**Success Criteria:**
- Human input limited to: initial brief + APPROVED/REJECTED/MODIFY at each gate
- Zero human involvement in artifact generation, review, or iteration
- AvA loop runs automatically with no manual triggering
- GitHub Actions orchestrates all pipeline steps

**Measurement:**
- Human actions per project: ≤ number of milestones + 1 (brief)
- Automation rate: ≥ 95% of all steps automated

---

## Objective 2: Adversarial Quality Control on Every Artifact

**Statement:** Every artifact produced by VASH must pass a Junior→Senior adversarial review before reaching the human. No artifact skips AvA.

**Success Criteria:**
- 100% of artifacts have AvA log in runtime/ava_logs/
- Junior and Senior run in isolated context windows (no shared memory)
- Minimum score threshold enforced before artifact is promoted
- Stalemate detection prevents infinite loops

**Measurement:**
- AvA coverage: 100% of artifacts
- Average AvA rounds per artifact: ≤ 2
- Artifacts reaching human below threshold: 0%

---

## Objective 3: Reusable Skills Over Reinvention

**Statement:** VASH must search for existing skills before building new ones. Every skill has documented search evidence. Skills accumulate across projects.

**Success Criteria:**
- search_log.md documents every skill search
- Marketplace reuse rate ≥ 60% for skill categories
- Custom skills built only when no marketplace match found
- Skills are portable across VASH projects

**Measurement:**
- Skills reused from marketplace vs built new: tracked in search_log.md
- Skill reuse rate per project: reported in project blueprint

---

## Objective 4: Technology Agnostic Output

**Statement:** All software produced BY VASH must be free of proprietary lock-in. Technology stack is decided per project by the Architecture agent — not hardcoded.

**Success Criteria:**
- No proprietary SDK in any generated artifact
- Database, cloud, and language decisions documented in ADR
- Every technology choice has a free-tier or open-source option
- Exit strategy documented for every vendor dependency

**Measurement:**
- LAW 1 compliance score per project: 100%
- Proprietary dependencies in generated artifacts: 0

---

## Objective 5: Human Gateway Efficiency

**Statement:** The human owner must be able to review, decide, and unblock the pipeline in under 5 minutes per milestone.

**Success Criteria:**
- Validation summary is ≤ 1 page, plain English, no jargon
- Decision options are explicit: APPROVED / REJECTED / MODIFY
- Human types one line to proceed
- Notification arrives via GitHub Issue automatically

**Measurement:**
- Average human review time per milestone: ≤ 5 minutes
- Notification delivery time after artifact completion: ≤ 2 minutes

---

## Objective 6: Phase 0 Complete Before Phase 1 Begins

**Statement:** The VASH framework must be fully operational — all infrastructure, skills, agents, and automation in place — before any client project is attempted.

**Success Criteria:**
- All Phase 0 activities PASS
- GitHub Actions pipeline tested end-to-end
- OAuth token authenticated
- All skills and agents deployed

**Measurement:**
- Phase 0 completion: 13/13 activities PASS ✅ (achieved)

## Overall Success Definition

VASH 3.0 is successful when:
1. A human submits a one-page brief
2. VASH produces a complete technical blueprint in ≤ 24 hours
3. Every artifact has passed AvA with score ≥ 88
4. Human has approved each milestone in ≤ 5 minutes per review
5. Zero proprietary lock-in in any output
6. Total cost: $0 — open source and pooled free tiers only (Amended by 2.6, in force when ADR-001 is ACCEPTED; owner exception: Claude for VASH's own development until the owner changes it, OD-1)
