## What Is VASH 3.0

VASH 3.0 (Virtual AI Software House) is a fully automated software development framework in which AI agents work in defined professional roles — governed by three inviolable laws, equipped with reusable skills, and subject to adversarial quality control — to design, plan, and blueprint enterprise-grade software for any industry.

VASH is not a chatbot, not a single AI assistant, and not a code autocomplete tool. It is a structured system of specialised agents that collectively perform the work of a software team: receiving a brief, running discovery, producing design artifacts, challenging those artifacts through adversarial review, and delivering a verified technical blueprint — with the human providing the brief and approving milestones only.

## Research Foundation — LAW 3 Applied

Before designing VASH 3.0, three search categories were investigated to ensure VASH reuses existing work rather than reinventing it. This section documents what was searched, what was found, what was reused, and what required new construction.

### Search Category 1: Multi-Agent Orchestration Frameworks

**Searched:** AutoGPT, CrewAI, LangGraph, AutoGen, MetaGPT, Agency Swarm

**Found:**
- CrewAI provides role-based agent definition with tool access, task routing, and process types (sequential, hierarchical). Open source, free tier. Reusable as orchestration layer if VASH requires agent-to-agent task delegation at runtime.
- LangGraph provides stateful graph execution for multi-step agent workflows. Open source. Reusable for workflow state management.
- MetaGPT assigns software-team roles (PM, architect, engineer) to LLM agents and produces structured outputs. Closest conceptual match to VASH. Does not include adversarial review loops, does not enforce a no-code-until-approved rule, and does not implement a skills-over-reinvention law.
- AutoGPT and AutoGen are general autonomous agent systems without domain-specific role definitions or quality gates.

**Reused:** The role-based agent model (from CrewAI/MetaGPT) informs VASH's agent role structure. Sequential and hierarchical process models inform activity sequencing.

**Built new:** The AvA (Adversarial vs Adversarial) quality loop — Junior generates, Senior reviews, score must meet threshold — does not exist in any framework reviewed. All existing frameworks trust agent output without a mandatory adversarial challenge cycle. VASH builds this new because quality assurance at artifact level is the core differentiator.

### Search Category 2: AI-Assisted Development and Coding Tools

**Searched:** GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Windsurf, Devin, SWE-agent, Aider

**Found:**
- GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Windsurf: inline code suggestion tools for individual developer workflows. No SDLC structure, no artifact trail, no design-before-build enforcement.
- Devin: autonomous software engineer agent that writes and runs code end-to-end. Operates on a single codebase task, not a full SDLC. No adversarial review, no artifact production pipeline.
- SWE-agent: academic research agent for resolving GitHub issues. Not a production framework.
- Aider: CLI-based AI pair programmer. Developer-in-loop, not autonomous.

**Reused:** None of these tools are reused. They operate at the individual-developer or single-task level and have no concept of phased SDLC, adversarial review, or artifact governance.

**Built new:** The SDLC pipeline (vision → requirements → architecture → design → blueprint) with mandatory artifact production and AvA gate at each phase is new in VASH because no existing tool governs the full planning-to-blueprint lifecycle with quality enforcement.

### Search Category 3: Skills Marketplaces and Prompt Libraries

**Searched:** Claude Code skills marketplace, Anthropic documentation, LangChain hub, PromptBase, GitHub repositories tagged `llm-agents`, `ai-skills`

**Found:**
- Claude Code skills system: composable, invokable skill units with defined inputs and outputs. Active marketplace. Directly reusable.
- Skills found and reused in VASH development: `prompt-engineer` (prompt generation), `code-reviewer` (adversarial review), `senior-architect` (architecture review), `multi-agent-patterns` (AvA loop orchestration). See `.claude/CLAUDE.md` for full skills manifest.
- LangChain hub: prompt templates for common agent tasks. Useful reference but not directly invokable in Claude Code context.

**Reused:** Four skills from the Claude Code marketplace are active in the VASH development workflow. The skills-first principle is demonstrated by VASH consuming its own LAW 3 before recommending it to clients.

**Built new:** `vash-creator`, `vash-validator`, `vash-orchestrator` — three custom skills built because no marketplace equivalent exists for VASH-specific artifact generation, VASH-specific scoring, and VASH-specific AvA loop management.

## The Problem VASH Solves

### The Current State

Building software from idea to production-ready blueprint requires:

- A product manager to translate business intent into requirements
- A solutions architect to define system structure and technology choices
- A senior engineer to validate technical feasibility
- A QA lead to define test strategy
- Coordination overhead between all of the above
- Multiple review cycles before a single design is approved

Each of these roles must be hired, onboarded, retained, and managed. For a solo founder or small company, this cost and overhead is prohibitive before any software has been validated in market. For a large company, the bottleneck is coordination — the calendar overhead of synchronising specialists across a design cycle.

### The VASH Answer

VASH replaces the coordination layer with:

- AI agents in defined professional roles (architect, engineer, reviewer, PM analogue)
- Reusable skills that encode domain expertise and do not leave when a person does
- An adversarial quality loop (AvA) that challenges every artifact before it is accepted
- A structured phase sequence that enforces design before build
- A human owner who provides the brief and approves milestones only — never builds manually

The human contribution shifts from execution to judgment: reviewing verified artifacts produced by agents rather than managing the people who produce them.

## Who VASH Serves

### Primary: The Solo Founder or Early-Stage Team

A founder with domain expertise and a clear product vision who cannot afford a full-time engineering and architecture team. VASH delivers the planning and design artifacts that previously required a team: ADRs, FRDs, data models, API contracts, infrastructure blueprints. The founder provides a product brief and approves the output.

### Secondary: The Enterprise Innovation Team

A corporate team that needs to prototype and validate new product directions rapidly without assigning full engineering resources to unproven concepts. VASH produces a validated technical blueprint fast enough to inform a go/no-go decision before a team is staffed.

### Tertiary: The Consultancy or Agency

A firm that delivers software design and architecture services. VASH augments human consultants with structured agent workflows and adversarial review — increasing throughput and consistency without proportional headcount growth.

## What VASH Produces

VASH produces complete technical blueprints for software projects. Every artifact is produced by an agent, reviewed adversarially by a second agent, and must score above the defined threshold before being accepted.

**Phase 1 Outputs — Vision and Requirements:**
- VASH 3.0 Vision Document (this artifact)
- Stakeholder and User Analysis
- Functional Requirements Document

**Phase 2 Outputs — Architecture and Design:**
- Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
- System Architecture Document
- Data Models and Schema Definitions
- API Contracts (OpenAPI-compliant specifications)
- Infrastructure Design (technology-agnostic)

**Phase 3 Outputs — Build Blueprint:**
- Technical Design Documents
- Test Plans and Test Cases
- Deployment Runbooks
- Security and Compliance Checklist

**Every artifact is:**
- Produced by Junior Creator agent
- Reviewed by Senior Validator agent with adversarial challenge
- Scored against a published checklist with a defined threshold
- Logged in `runtime/ava_logs/` with full round history
- Saved to `runtime/artifacts/` with full content — never a summary

## V3.0 Scope Boundary

VASH 3.0 is a design and planning engine. The following are explicitly outside the scope of V3.0 and deferred:

**Deferred — Code Generation:** VASH 3.0 produces technical blueprints and specifications. It does not write, execute, or test source code. Code generation requires a code-execution environment and is planned for a subsequent phase after the design pipeline is validated.

**Deferred — Deployment Execution:** VASH 3.0 produces Infrastructure as Code specifications and deployment runbooks. It does not provision cloud resources, execute deployments, or manage running infrastructure.

**Deferred — Client-Facing Product UI:** VASH 3.0 operates through a command-line and file-based interface. A product UI for non-technical clients is deferred until the core pipeline is stable and the interaction model is validated.

**Deferred — Multi-Client Isolation:** VASH 3.0 operates as a single-project framework. Multi-tenancy, project isolation, and client workspace management are deferred until the single-project pipeline is complete.

**Deferred — Autonomous Brief Intake:** In V3.0, a human structures the product brief. Automated brief intake (natural language brief → structured activity list) is deferred.

## How VASH Is Different — Falsifiable Capability Comparison

### vs GitHub Copilot / Cursor / Windsurf

These tools provide inline code suggestions to an individual developer inside a coding environment. They have no concept of an SDLC, produce no architecture artifacts, run no quality gates, and do not operate without a human driving every action.

**Falsifiable difference:** Copilot cannot produce an Architecture Decision Record, a Data Model, or an API Contract without a human writing the surrounding context and accepting each suggestion line by line. VASH produces those artifacts end-to-end with no human in the production loop.

### vs AutoGPT / CrewAI / LangGraph

These are orchestration frameworks. They provide machinery to connect agents but impose no domain structure, no artifact schema, no quality gate, and no phase sequence. A developer must design the agent workflow, define the roles, and build the quality controls.

**Falsifiable difference:** CrewAI does not enforce a scoring threshold before an artifact is accepted. VASH requires every artifact to score above the defined threshold (e.g., 90) in adversarial AvA review or the activity fails and must be retried. This structural quality gate is absent from all frameworks reviewed.

### vs MetaGPT

MetaGPT is the closest conceptual match: it assigns software-team roles to LLM agents and produces structured documents. It does not include an adversarial review loop, does not enforce a design-before-code rule through a phase gate, and does not implement a skills-reuse law with documented search evidence.

**Falsifiable difference:** MetaGPT will produce code if asked. VASH 3.0 refuses to produce code — agents cannot cross the design-to-build boundary without a phase gate approval. This is enforced structurally, not by prompt instruction alone.

### vs Hiring a Design and Architecture Team

A human team provides creativity, judgment, and contextual understanding that agents do not match. VASH preserves human judgment at the milestone approval level (where strategic decisions are made) and replaces human execution at the artifact production level (where volume, consistency, and speed are the primary variables). VASH does not claim to replace human creativity — it claims to replace the coordination and execution overhead around it.

**Falsifiable difference:** A human architect produces one ADR per review cycle. VASH can run multiple architecture activities in parallel (PARALLEL_SAFE activities) and produce multiple reviewed artifacts in the same session. Throughput at the artifact production level scales with compute, not headcount.

## LAW Compliance — Substantive

### LAW 1 — VANILLA FIRST

**Mechanism for VASH infrastructure:** Every platform component used to run VASH must be available on an open source or free tier. Any tool selection that requires a paid tier must be flagged, an open source alternative evaluated first, and the decision documented with rationale for human approval.

**Current VASH stack compliance:** GitHub (free tier for public repos), Claude AI (VASH development tooling — explicitly permitted by LAW 1), Python (open source). No paid infrastructure dependency in V3.0.

**Mechanism for software built by VASH:** Every project VASH designs must use database-agnostic, cloud-agnostic patterns. No vendor lock-in in data models, API contracts, or infrastructure blueprints. Technology selection is made per project by agents based on project requirements — not defaulted to a proprietary stack.

### LAW 2 — AGENT OVER HUMAN

**Mechanism — What agents do:**
- Read the activity list and select the next activity
- Generate prompts for each activity
- Produce artifacts in defined formats
- Run adversarial AvA review (Junior generates, Senior challenges)
- Score artifacts against published checklists
- Save logs, artifacts, and validation records
- Escalate failures with documented root cause and restart path

**Mechanism — What the human does:**
- Submits the product brief
- Reviews milestone artifacts (the approved output, not the production process)
- Approves or rejects at defined milestone gates
- Does not write prompts, edit artifacts, or manage agent workflow

**What this law prohibits:** An agent that halts mid-activity and asks a human to unblock a process step is violating LAW 2. The agent must be configured with the permissions it needs before the activity starts. Human intervention in the production loop is a tooling failure, not an expected workflow.

### LAW 3 — SKILLS OVER REINVENTION

**Mechanism:** Every activity that selects a technology or builds a new skill must include a Research Foundation section documenting: what was searched, what was found, what was reused, what was built new, and why building new was justified.

**Current evidence:** The Research Foundation section of this artifact documents three search categories completed before designing VASH 3.0. Four Claude Code marketplace skills are actively reused in the VASH development workflow. Three custom skills were built new only after confirming no marketplace equivalent existed.

**What this law prohibits:** Selecting a technology or building a skill without a documented search first. The search must be documented so future agents and human reviewers can audit the decision.

## VASH Evolution Arc

### V3.0 — The Design Engine

VASH 3.0 is the design and planning engine. Its scope is bounded by a deliberate constraint: agents produce artifacts, not code. This constraint exists because the quality-control infrastructure — the AvA loop, the scoring system, the artifact schema — must be validated on design outputs before it can be trusted on executable code. A design artifact that fails can be discarded and regenerated; a code artifact that fails can break a running system. V3.0 establishes the framework, the laws, the quality gates, and the artifact pipeline. It delivers a production-ready technical blueprint from a one-page brief. It does not write the software that blueprint describes.

### V4.0 — The Build Engine

V4.0 extends the validated design pipeline into code generation and deployment. The same AvA quality loop applied to design artifacts in V3.0 will gate code artifacts in V4.0: Junior writes code, Senior reviews it, score must meet threshold before the artifact is accepted. The laws do not change — LAW 1 (open source stack), LAW 2 (agent over human), LAW 3 (skills over reinvention) apply equally to build-phase work. V4.0 adds a code-execution environment, test-runner integration, and deployment automation. The human milestone approval model is preserved: the human approves the build plan and the deployment, not the individual commits. V4.0 is not started until V3.0 has produced at least one complete client project from brief to validated blueprint, demonstrating that the design pipeline is stable.

---

## The North Star

VASH 3.0 is complete when a solo founder submits a one-page product brief and receives a production-ready technical blueprint — architecture decisions, data models, API contracts, infrastructure design — all reviewed through adversarial AvA and scored above threshold, with their only input being milestone approvals at defined phase gates.

The measure of success is not agent capability. It is artifact quality: every document produced by VASH must be detailed enough that a competent engineering team can build from it without asking clarifying questions.

## Amendment by 2.6 — VASH as the Application Framework (ADR-001, 5 Nov 2026)

This amendment is PROPOSED: it takes effect when ADR-001 is ACCEPTED, and then supersedes the statements above where they conflict. Full detail:
vash_framework/architecture/2-6_application_framework.md.

1. **What VASH is.** VASH is the application framework used by every application: the method
   (laws, AvA, roles, groups, handshakes, SDLC phases), the engine (built in Phase 7) and the catalog
   (vetted stack packs, skills, agents and tools). Projects such as KYC and COMMON live in their own
   private repositories and use a pinned VASH version.
2. **Who decides a project's stack.** VASH's agents propose the stack, skills, agents and tools from the
   catalog; the human accepts the ADR; VASH writes the project's Freeze file (project-stack.json) and
   provisions the project repository.
3. **Cost.** The "Current VASH stack compliance" statement in the LAW 1 section above ("Claude AI (VASH
   development tooling — explicitly permitted by LAW 1)") is superseded: LAW 1
   now requires $0 through pooled free tiers and local models. VASH's own development uses Claude as
   its main AI tooling until the owner changes it (owner decision OD-1, 5 Nov 2026).
4. **Evolution.** The step from design to code ("V4.0" above) is brought into VASH 3.x as activity-list
   Phase 7 — Engine Build, after the blueprint (6.1) is approved. The V4.0 entry condition above ("not
   started until V3.0 has produced at least one complete client project") is replaced by "after 6.1 is
   approved" (D9, OD-5); the engine is needed to deliver the first project. Projects' code is built by the engine under the
   same AvA loop, with a deterministic Gate 1 before every Senior review.
5. **Visibility.** VASH is public (MIT). Client projects are private. No client data enters VASH.
